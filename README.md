# CList
Coordinate List (CList for short) is a simple minimalistic fabric mod for saving your coordinates. No minimaps. Just a list with in-game waypoints.

This mod includes:
- hotkey for placing a waypoint in the current position.
- automatic waypoints in the place where you died.
- copying the waypoint coordinates by clicking the button with coordinates in the waypoint menu.
- toggle waypoint visibility.
- changing the size of the waypoint to your liking.
- no minimap.

(If you want to help and know any other language than English you can help by translating the mod [here](https://github.com/PouekDEV/CList/tree/1.20.2/src/main/resources/assets/coordinatelist/lang) by making a pull request)

I initially created this mod just for me and my friends but I thought somebody would find it helpful. I'm not too fond of these waypoint mods which always have built-in minimap which lagged my game even when it was off. So I made my own mod to fulfill the need for a lightweight, minimalistic waypoint mod.

I hope that it'll help you.
